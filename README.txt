This README.txt accompanies the code for The Wi-Fi Seeker project.

The Wi-Fi Seeker is an ECE Senior Design Project completed for Group #30 in the Fall 2014 -
Spring 2015 semesters. The codebase is comprised of two parts: the code for the MSP430F5529
microcontroller, and the code for the Android application.

The MSPSourceCode folder contains the files for the code that was loaded onto the microcontroller.
Code Composer Studio v6 was used, but you must also install Energia and add the appropriate
libraries to the project in order for the code to compile correctly.

The AndroidSourceCode folder contains the files for the code that created the Android Application.
AndroidStudoProjects, the IDE by Google, was used for development. The application was
developed for KitKat, Android version 4.4. The provided source code, resources, and 
AndroidManifest should be enough to create a new project based off of these resources.
